# Foodiolla

This is just a project idea and preview which we used for project exhibition.

## Installation

```python
pip install flask
```

## Usage

```python
python app.py
```

The Terminal will load up the files and give you a page with the following link

```python
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Just add 'home' after the slash

```python
http://127.0.0.1:5000/home
```
